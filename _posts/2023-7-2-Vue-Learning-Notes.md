On Day 10 of our Vue.js journey, we'll dive into one of the most essential concepts in Vue.js and modern web development in general: components. We'll learn what components are, why they're important, and how to create them in Vue.js.

## Understanding What Components Are and Their Importance

In Vue.js, a component is a reusable, self-contained piece of code that encapsulates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that belong together as a single entity. They are the building blocks of any Vue.js application. Components allow us to build large-scale applications composed of small, independent, and often reusable pieces.

Here's an example of a Vue.js component:

```javascript
Vue.component('my-component', {
  template: '<div>A custom component!</div>'
})
```

In this example, we define a new component called 'my-component'. This component can be used like a new HTML element in our Vue templates.

## Learning How to Create Components in Vue.js

Creating a component in Vue.js is straightforward. We use the `Vue.component` method, which takes two arguments: the name of the component and an options object. The options object can contain data, methods, computed properties, and more.

```javascript
Vue.component('button-counter', {
  data: function() {
    return {
      count: 0
    }
  },
  template: '<button v-on:click="count++">You clicked me {{ count }} times.</button>'
})
```

In this example, we create a 'button-counter' component. This component has its own data property `count` and displays a button that, when clicked, increments the `count`.

That's all for today! Tomorrow, we'll continue our exploration of Vue.js components and learn how to pass data to components using props. Stay tuned!
