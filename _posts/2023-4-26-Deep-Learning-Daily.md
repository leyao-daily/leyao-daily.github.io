## Activation Functions

Activation functions are an essential component of neural networks. They determine the output of a neuron based on its input, allowing the network to learn complex, non-linear patterns in the data.

### Sigmoid

The sigmoid function squashes the input to a range between 0 and 1. It is commonly used in binary classification problems.

### Tanh

The tanh (hyperbolic tangent) function is similar to the sigmoid function but squashes the input to a range between -1 and 1. It is more centered around 0 than the sigmoid function.

### ReLU

The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function is a popular activation function due to its simplicity and efficiency. It outputs the input if it's positive, otherwise, it outputs 0.

### Leaky ReLU

The Leaky ReLU function is a variation of the ReLU function that allows a small, non-zero gradient for negative input values. This helps address the "dying ReLU" problem where neurons can become inactive and stop learning.

### Softmax

The softmax function is used in the output layer of a neural network for multi-class classification problems. It converts the input into a probability distribution over multiple classes.

## Layer Types

Different layer types serve various purposes in a neural network, from feature extraction to regularization.

### Dense (Fully Connected) Layers

Dense layers, also known as fully connected layers, are the most common type of layers in neural networks. Each neuron in a dense layer is connected to every neuron in the previous layer.

### Convolutional Layers

Convolutional layers are used in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image and signal processing tasks. They apply convolution operations to the input, allowing the network to learn spatial features.

### Pooling Layers

Pooling layers are used in CNNs to reduce the spatial dimensions of the input, helping reduce the number of parameters and computational complexity of the model. Common types of pooling layers include max pooling and average pooling.

### Recurrent Layers

Recurrent layers are used in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence-to-sequence and time series tasks. They have connections between neurons across time steps, allowing the network to learn temporal patterns in the data. Popular recurrent layers include LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) layers.

### Batch Normalization Layers

Batch normalization layers are used to normalize the inputs of a layer to improve the training process's stability and speed. They can also have a slight regularization effect, helping reduce overfitting.

### Dropout Layers

Dropout layers are used for regularization in neural networks. During training, they randomly set a fraction of input units to 0 at each update, which helps prevent overfitting by reducing the network's reliance on individual neurons.

That's it for Day 6! We have covered various activation functions and layer types used in neural networks. In the next post, we will discuss more advanced topics in deep learning, such as training techniques, optimization algorithms, and regularization methods. Stay tuned!
