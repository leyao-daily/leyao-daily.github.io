# Rust Daily Learning - Day 13

## Overview

Welcome to Day 13 of the Rust daily learning series! Today, we'll dive into lifetimes in Rust, which help ensure memory safety and prevent issues such as dangling references.

## Lifetimes

A lifetime is a construct the Rust compiler uses to ensure that references are valid for the duration of their use. Lifetimes are denoted with an apostrophe followed by a name, like `'a`. When you have multiple references with different lifetimes, the Rust compiler checks that they don't outlive each other.

Let's look at an example that requires explicit lifetime annotations:

```rust
struct Person<'a> {
    name: &'a str,
}

impl<'a> Person<'a> {
    fn greet(&self) {
        println!("Hello, my name is {}", self.name);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let name = String::from("Alice");
    let person = Person { name: &name };
    person.greet();
}
```

In this example, we define a `Person` struct with a `name` field of type `&'a str`. The lifetime annotation `'a` indicates that the reference to the name string has a specific lifetime. We also need to add the lifetime annotation to the `impl` block for the `Person` struct, ensuring that the `greet` method is aware of the lifetime.

By using lifetimes, Rust ensures that the `name` field's reference remains valid for the duration of the `Person` struct's usage.

Lifetimes can be complex, but they are an essential part of Rust's memory safety guarantees. Understanding and working with lifetimes helps you write safe and efficient code in Rust.
