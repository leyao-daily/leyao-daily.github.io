On Day 12, we'll take a step back to review everything we've learned about Vue.js components over the past few days. We'll revisit the concepts of creating components, parent-child communication, and the use of props and events. Then, we'll put our knowledge into practice with some hands-on exercises and mini-projects.

## Reviewing Vue.js Components and Communication Between Components

Components are the building blocks of any Vue.js application. They are reusable, self-contained pieces of code that encapsulate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We can create components using the `Vue.component` method, and use them in our Vue templates just like new HTML elements.

Parent-child component communication in Vue.js is facilitated through props and events. Props allow us to pass data from a parent component down to a child component, while events let a child component trigger actions in its parent component.

## Hands-On Exercises and Mini-Projects

Now, it's time to put theory into practice. Here are a few exercises and mini-projects you can do to reinforce your understanding of Vue.js components:

1. **Exercise 1: Create a Simple Component**  
   Create a simple Vue.js component that displays a message. The message should be a prop passed from the parent component.

2. **Exercise 2: Parent-Child Communication**  
   Create a parent component and a child component. The parent should pass a message to the child using a prop, and the child should notify the parent when it receives the message by emitting an event.

3. **Mini-Project: Todo List**  
   Create a simple todo list application using Vue.js components. The application should have at least two components: a `TodoList` component and a `TodoItem` component. The `TodoList` component should pass a list of todos to the `TodoItem` component using props, and the `TodoItem` component should notify the `TodoList` when a todo is completed by emitting an event.

Remember, practice is key when learning a new skill. Take your time with these exercises and projects, and don't hesitate to revisit previous lessons if you need to. Happy coding!

That's all for today! Tomorrow, we'll explore Vue Router, an essential tool for building single-page applications with Vue.js. Stay tuned!
