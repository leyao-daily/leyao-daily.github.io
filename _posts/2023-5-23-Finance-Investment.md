## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome to the eighth course in our series on quantitative finance and investment. In this course, we will introduce the concepts and application of machine learning techniques in finance.

## Why Machine Learning in Finance? <a name="why-ml"></a>

Machine learning offers powerful tools for predictive modeling and decision-making in finance. It's used in a variety of financial domains including algorithmic trading, portfolio management, loan approval, fraud detection, and risk management.

## Types of Machine Learning <a name="types"></a>

There are several types of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. Each of these has unique applications in the realm of finance.

## Common Machine Learning Techniques in Finance <a name="techniques"></a>

Several machine learning techniques are commonly used in finance, including linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, k-means clustering, and time series forecasting, among others. We'll go over each of these and how they can be applied in a financial context.

## Case Study: Predicting Stock Prices <a name="case-study"></a>

To demonstrate the power of machine learning in finance, we'll present a case study where we use historical data to predict future stock prices. We'll walk through the steps of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation.

## Limitations and Risks <a name="limitations"></a>

While machine learning offers powerful tools for finance, it also comes with limitations and risks. Overfitting, interpretability, and the danger of algorithmic bias are just a few examples. We'll discuss these in detail and explore ways to mitigate them.

## Summary <a name="summary"></a>

This course introduced the application of machine learning techniques in finance. We covered why machine learning is important in finance, different types of machine learning, common techniques used in finance, and presented a case study on predicting stock prices. Understanding these concepts is key for any modern financial analyst or investor.
