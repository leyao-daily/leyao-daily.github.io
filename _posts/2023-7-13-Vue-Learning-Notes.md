Welcome to Day 21 of our Vue.js journey! Today, we'll take the time to review and reinforce our knowledge of the Vue.js 3 Composition API. We'll revisit the key concepts we've covered and engage in hands-on exercises to practice and solidify our understanding.

## Reviewing Vue.js 3 Composition API

Throughout our journey, we've explored the Vue.js 3 Composition API and learned how it provides a more modular and flexible approach to organizing our code. We've covered essential topics such as reactive variables with `ref` and `reactive`, computed properties, and watchers. We've also discussed the advantages of using the Composition API and how it enhances code organization and reusability.

## Hands-On Exercises

Now, let's put our knowledge into practice with some hands-on exercises. These exercises will help us further strengthen our skills and understanding of the Vue.js 3 Composition API.

1. **Exercise 1: Counter Component**  
   Create a counter component using the Composition API. Implement reactive variables to track the count, computed properties to calculate derived values, and watchers to log count changes to the console.

2. **Exercise 2: Form Validation**  
   Build a form validation system using the Composition API. Use reactive variables to hold form inputs, computed properties to validate the inputs, and watchers to display error messages based on the input changes.

3. **Exercise 3: Todo List**  
   Develop a simple todo list application using the Composition API. Utilize reactive variables to store the list of tasks, computed properties to filter and sort the tasks, and watchers to trigger actions when tasks are marked as completed.

Take your time with these exercises, experiment with different Composition API features, and explore additional possibilities to further enhance your understanding.

That's all for today! Tomorrow, we'll dive into more advanced topics as we explore Vue.js 3 directives and custom directives. Stay tuned!
