## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

A capstone project showcase is an opportunity to share your work with an audience, typically including peers, faculty, or industry professionals. It's a chance to demonstrate your understanding of LLMs, your technical skills, and your ability to communicate complex ideas.

## Preparing Your Presentation <a name="preparing-your-presentation"></a>

The first step is to prepare your presentation. Here are some key aspects to consider:

1. **Structure**: Organize your presentation logically. Typically, you'll want to introduce your project, explain your methods, present your results, discuss your learnings, and suggest future work.
2. **Visuals**: Use visuals like slides, diagrams, or graphs to illustrate your points and keep your audience engaged.
3. **Practice**: Rehearse your presentation to ensure you can deliver it smoothly and confidently.

## Presenting Your Work <a name="presenting-your-work"></a>

When it's time to present, keep these tips in mind:

1. **Clear Communication**: Explain your work clearly and succinctly. Avoid jargon or overly complex language.
2. **Time Management**: Ensure you stay within your allotted time to avoid rushing or omitting important information.
3. **Engagement**: Try to engage your audience. You could pose questions, invite input, or use interactive elements.

## Handling Questions <a name="handling-questions"></a>

After your presentation, you'll likely need to answer questions. Here are some strategies:

1. **Listen Carefully**: Make sure you understand the question before you start to answer.
2. **Think Before You Speak**: Take a moment to gather your thoughts before responding.
3. **Stay Calm**: If you don't know the answer, it's okay to say so. You could suggest how you might find the answer, or offer to follow up later.

## Reviewing Your Performance <a name="reviewing-your-performance"></a>

After the showcase, take the time to review your performance. Reflect on what went well, and identify any areas for improvement. Consider seeking feedback from your peers, mentors, or audience members.
